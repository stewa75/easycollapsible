Esaycollapsible is an easy plugin to make topics format courses collapsible.
Isn't there already one famous plugin making the same things?
Yes, but I do not like it, it was too complex and it didn't work good with my Lambda theme. So I create this new plugin. It is:

- fully localized
- very light
- theme independent
- really smart

It has been tested on Lambda and Boost. If you have any problem please visit the page:
